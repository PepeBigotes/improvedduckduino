<h2>About</h2>

This is a fork of the "duckduino" tool, which is used to modify the firmware of an "Arduino Uno" board to make it act like a RubberDucky.  
Check out the original version of the [duckduino tool](https://github.com/Lacerda53/duckduino).  
<h3>This improved version counts with:</h3>

- Easy to use "dependencies", "autoremove" and "update" shell scripts.
- Simplified main script.
- Out of the box template and payloads (WIP).  
<h2>Installation</h2>

You can install this tool easily using the "git" package.  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PepeBigotes/improvedduckduino
```  
After that execute the "dependencies" script and you will be ready to use the duckduino tool.
```bash
chmod +x dependencies.sh && ./dependencies.sh
```
